           INSTRUCTIONS
          
The compressed tar file icf.tar.gz contains the MINPACK-2 
incomplete Cholesky factorization and a test program.

1. Create the icf directory structure with

       gzip -d icf.tar.gz
       tar -xvf icf.tar

   This produces the directory icf and several subdirectories.

2. Set the environment variable ARCH. Installation has been tested
   on linux, rs6000, solaris, irix, and alpha systems. Installation 
   usually works on other systems but has not been tested. The file
   README in the utils directory contains more systems information.

3. Change directories to icf and install icf with
 
       make install

   This creates libraries in each of the subdirectories and
   the executable icf

4. Run the sample problems by executing icf, and compare the output in 
   icf.info with the output on a similar system, icf.linux, for example.


*****************************************************************

      INSTRUCTIONS for MATLAB interface
 
1. Change directory to the matlab subdirectory

2. If you have not installed the icf library
 
       make install

3. Create the mex files with
 
       make matlab
 
   and run the test program cgtest.m from MATLAB
