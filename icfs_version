           VERSIONS
          
Version 1.0

  Released May 1998.

Version 1.1

  Released October 1998.

  Fixes a bug in dicfs.f brought to our attention by Michael Ulbrich.
  The search for a suitable shift alpha ended prematurely for small n.
  In the example, n = 3. The termination criteria for the shift is now
  independent of n.

Version 1.2

  Released February 1999.

  This version includes the MATLAB interface.

Version 1.3

  Released February 2001.

  Updates subroutine dsel2.f with the version of October 1999
  where the length of x is now set to *. Version 1.2 gave correct 
  results but also issued warnings if array bounds were checked.

  The blas routines included with this release were also updated,
  but in all cases, usage of machine-specific blas is recommended.

  The main README file now specifically asks that the ARCH environment
  variable be set, while the README file in the UTILS directory
  provides system-dependent information.

  The timing routines in the UTILS directory have also been updated.

Version 1.4

  Released April 2001.

  Added subroutine dsel.f to the distribution since, as noted by
  Krzysztof C. Kiwiel, this code is of independent interest in algorithms
  for the continuous quadratic knapsack.
