The Makefile in the UTILS directory assumes that the ARCH environment
variable has been set correctly. Installation has has been tested on
linux, rs6000, solaris, irix, and alpha systems. On some systems the
ARCH environment variable has been set to another name.  For example,
on the rs6000 the ARCH environment variable is sometimes set to aix.

If the Makefile in the UTILS directory does not work, you need to
replace cputime.F by another function that measures cpu time on your
system.

Another option is to eliminate cputime and use the wallclock function
supplied in this directory. This requires replacing cputime by
wallclock in the driver.f file.
